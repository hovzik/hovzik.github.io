				<p>i believe that most of my work behaves as a visual poem.</p>
				<p>it is trying to find the balance between the domain of language and beyond which cannot be articulated, visualising a metaphor that finds its root in a concept that had been defined as a thought yet originated initially from a deeply felt inclination of the self.</p>
				<p>dealing with the memory and the fragmentation of narrative, it wishes to embody a sense of identity, referring to the ideas about the placement of the self within the historical and social framework, as eternally suspended between the future and the past. it evokes the topics of displacement and the necessity of adjustment in the midst of migration, translating its longing for a safe space and a sense of belonging into a generalised media nostalgia. it searches for the authentic and the warmly human, afraid of the alienating world of spectacle and the abundance of digitalised simulacra of contemporary culture.</p>

				<p>recently, i have discovered that the process of artistic research, as a curiosity-driven knowledge pursuit, provides a platform of exploration that balances between the objective and the subjective which forms a substantial foundation for the creation of an artwork. in the future, i <wbr>ould like to further investigate the differentiation between established objects of knowledge on one side, and art as another medium of communication and transmission of felt knowledge on the other.</p>

				<p>the current questions that have arisen tackle the issues of institutionalisation and the established power structure, and the concepts of ecological space and the possibility of symbiotic coexistence.</p>
