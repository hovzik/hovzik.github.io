				<p>impermanence inverted, 2018<br><br>

				plaster, bandages<br><br><br>


				with the edible inside of the pomegranate, what <br>remains is the peel — the negative imprint of <br>what once existed. dozens of fertile seeds <br>enveloped in irresistible bursting fructose.<br><br>
 
				the image of the pomegranate retains all its <br>mythical and symbolic associations — the fruit <br>of birth and fertility, yet the fruit that can <br>unrepairable bound the one it seduces to the <br>eternity of the underworld. with its <br>disappearance, the shadow its left, becoming a <br>carrier of its negative presence — the viola <br>that is left where it once existed. it is this <br>negative space that is used as a locus of new <br>growth — in this case, an artificially <br>stimulated recreation, the re-crystallisation <br>of the presence disappeared.</p>

				<p>the newly occupied space, susceptible to the <br>organic remain of the peel, becomes the ground <br>for the natural processes of decomposition and <br>degradation of the remaining original matter <br>while embodying the essence of what is <br>inevitably disappearing. it becomes the <br>plasticity of what is being longed for.<br><br>
 
				the object itself becomes a hybrid between <br>what is inherited through the natural form used <br>and the human manipulation, and once liberated <br>from the hardened peel it can be distanced <br>from the essence of the fruit. it transgresses <br>from the particular specimen into the general <br>domain of the organic, becoming a deconstructed <br>ear of corn or the bodily in its familiarity. <br>it establishes itself as a micro biosphere, <br>providing the platform for the growth of <br>uncanny microorganisms, further visualising <br>the fragile relationship between the visible <br>and the individually imperceptible.</p>
